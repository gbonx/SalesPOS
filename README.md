# SalesPOS

A simple Excel POS VBA tool for micro business or associations (please note that this tool is not certified).
I did it for a micro business which needed a POS system for sales and stock management.
I know Excel is not a very professional solution but I think it is the fastest and easiest way to use such tools.

It permits to manage sales, customers and  products stocks.
Possibility to sale products or services.
At lease two letters have to be written in a combobox in order to view the items availables (I put some examples service/items which can be removed but sheet protections have to be removed).

This Excel may not work properly depending on your excel version and may need to be adapted (developped under Excel 2013).
Do not hesitate to contribute and improve this tool.

I have set some protections on all cells which should not be changed manually (can be removed in review menu but protection will be reset after macros is ran)

I am french so my english may not be perfect, sorry for that.

Hoping this tool will be usefull to you :)
